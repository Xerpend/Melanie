## Next Steps

The deep research orchestration system is now fully implemented and ready for integration into the broader Melanie AI ecosystem. The next logical steps would be:

1. **API Endpoint Integration** (Task 19) - Create `/chat/completions` endpoint that uses this orchestration system
2. **Files API Integration** - Connect file uploads to research workflows
3. **Web Interface Integration** - Add research capabilities to the web chat interface
4. **Performance Optimization** - Fine-tune concurrency and caching
5. **Advanced Features** - Add research templates and custom tool integration

The implementation successfully fulfills all requirements 4.1-4.8 and provides a robust foundation for AI-powered research workflows in the Melanie ecosystem.
